# Getting Started (Python)

> [!WARNING]
> Our Python SDK is currently in Public Preview. We're going to do our best to not ship breaking changes, but breaking changes may happen from time to time 

This guide will help you set up your first Teams AI Library application. You'll learn the basics of creating an application, understanding its structure, and running it locally. By the end of this guide, you'll have a solid foundation to build upon as you explore more advanced features and capabilities of the SDK.
