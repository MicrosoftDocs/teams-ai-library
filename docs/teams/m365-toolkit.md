# Teams Toolkit (preview)

[This article is prerelease documentation and is subject to change.]

Teams Toolkit is a powerful extension and CLI app available for customers that helps automate important tasks like manifest management, sideloading, deployment, and provisioning.

> [!NOTE]
> Please note that the Teams AI v2 library team does **NOT** manage Teams Toolkit, it is managed by the toolkit team. If you run into issues using [Teams Toolkit](https://github.com/OfficeDev/Teams-Toolkit), please contact their team team for support. Topics that fall under Teams Toolkit include using the extension, running apps chosen from Teams Toolkit, deployment and provisioning, and running the debugger via F5.
