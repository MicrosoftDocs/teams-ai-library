# Tabs (C#)

Tabs are host-aware webpages embedded in Microsoft Teams, Outlook, and Microsoft 365. Tabs are commonly implemented as Single Page Applications that use the Teams JavaScript client library.

This library does not offer features for implementing Tab apps in C#. It does however let you host tab apps and implement functions that can be called by Tab apps.
