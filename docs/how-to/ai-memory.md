# Memory

The cognitive process by which information is encoded, stored, and retrieved, allowing individuals to retain past experiences and knowledge for future use. It encompasses various types that vary in how long they are stored and what type of content is stored.

The two top level categories of memory are short term and long term. There are different types of long and short term memories that will be described in the following sections.

## Memory: Short Term

Stores a small amount of information for a brief period of time. It's often described as the brain's "working space" or "whiteboard".

### Working (Whiteboard)

Information needed for complex tasks such as problem-solving, comprehension, and decision-making. It actively processes information, allowing for real-time reasoning and learning.

## Memory: Long Term

Stores information for extended periods of time. It's where memories of events, knowledge, and experiences are stored and recalled.

### Episodic

Episodic memory is a type of long-term memory that involves the recollection of specific events, situations, and experiences, including the context in which they occurred, such as time and place. It enables individuals to remember personal past experiences.

### Semantic

A type of long-term memory that involves the storage and recall of general world knowledge, facts, concepts, and meanings, independent of personal experience or specific events. It includes things like vocabulary, historical dates, and mathematical concepts.
