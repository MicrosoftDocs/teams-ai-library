# Activity: Conversation

Bots will receive notifications for conversation events, which can be captured to take subsequent actions. For example, a bot can subscribe to the `membersAdded` event and send a welcome message when a team member is added to a conversation.

Teams has several unique conversation update activities that are not found in the original Agents protocol. Please see the [Conversation Update Events](./activity-conversation-update-event.md) section for more information.
