# Turn Context (preview) (TypeScript)

[This article is prerelease documentation and is subject to change.]

While BotBuilder has a `TurnContext`, Teams AI has `IActivityContext` which serves the same purpose.
The context is passed into activity handlers and provides a structured way for developers to interface
with apis and incoming data.
